A relative path, e.g. `mark relative/path/to/some/directory dirA`\r\n2. Marking the current directory, e.g. `mark . myCurrentDir`\r\n3. Marking the parent directiry, e.g. `mark .. myParentDir`\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n1. Unpack the [source](https://github.com/hasanein/BookmarkerScript/archive/0.1.zip) of the Bookmarker shell script into a directory of your choice and make sure that directory is included\r\nin your PATH environment variable.\r\n2. Edit your bash profile and add the following blocks of code.\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\n# Include aliases file created by the marker script\r\nif [ -f ~/.marker_functions ] ; then\t\r\n\tsource ~/.marker_functions\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\nfunction mark()\r\n{\r\n\tmarkme $*\r\n\t. ~/.bash_profile\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction umark()\r\n{\r\n\tumarkme $*\r\n\tunset $*\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Test-Driven shell scripting\r\nIf you are a big fan of test driven development (TDD) like myself, have a look at the [marker_test](https://github.com/hasanein/BookmarkerScript/blob/master/marker_test) script included with \r\nthe Bookmarker source which is my attempt to do TDD in bash scripts, how cool is that :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
